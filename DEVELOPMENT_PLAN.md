# BACHelp Packet Creation Plugin - Development Plan

## Overview

This development plan outlines the implementation strategy for the BACHelp Packet Creation plugin, which creates downloadable zip packets containing ticket PDFs and all attachments for auditing purposes.

## Development Phases

**Note**: Testing is integrated throughout each phase rather than deferred to the end. Each phase includes specific testing tasks to ensure quality and catch issues early.

class PacketCreationController < ApplicationController
  include Redmine::Export::PDF::IssuesPdfHelper
  before_action :find_issue
  before_action :authorize
  
  def create
    # Basic implementation without error handling
  end
  
  private
  
  def find_issue

## CURRENT STATUS (July 15, 2025)

### ✅ **WORKING FUNCTIONALITY**
- **Core packet creation works** - Users can successfully create and download ZIP packets
- **PDF generation** - Issues are converted to PDF using Redmine's built-in system
- **Attachment handling** - All issue attachments are included in the ZIP
- **Permission system** - Module-level and user-level permissions working
- **UI integration** - "Create Packet" button appears on issue pages with proper permissions
- **Basic error handling** - Graceful error handling with user feedback

### ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**
1. **Test Suite Issues**:
   - `test_create_packet_with_attachments` - **HANGS** in test environment
   - `test_create_packet_with_duplicate_filenames` - **HANGS** in test environment  
   - `test_create_packet_with_unreadable_attachment` - **HANGS** in test environment
   - Issue appears to be test environment file handling, not production code

2. **Functional Test Issues**:
   - Some functional tests expect different behavior than implemented
   - Tests need adjustment for actual controller behavior

### 🔄 **INCOMPLETE AREAS**
- **Comprehensive testing** - Need to resolve hanging tests and complete test suite
- **Performance testing** - No load testing or benchmarking done
- **Cross-browser testing** - Only basic browser testing
- **Documentation** - No user documentation or installation guides
- **Deployment process** - No formal deployment procedures

### 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITIES**
1. **Fix hanging tests** - Investigate why attachment-related tests hang
2. **Complete test suite** - Get all tests passing
3. **Performance testing** - Test with large files and multiple attachments
4. **Documentation** - Create user guides and installation documentation
5. **Deployment preparation** - Create proper deployment procedures

### 📊 **TEST RESULTS SUMMARY**
- **Service Tests**: 4/7 passing (3 skipped due to hanging)
- **View Listener Tests**: 6/6 passing ✅
- **Functional Tests**: Partial success (some need adjustment)
- **Overall**: Core functionality verified, test suite needs work

```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- Use `Redmine::Export::PDF::IssuesPdfHelper.issue_to_pdf`
- Use `Attachment.archive_attachments` or similar pattern
- Follow Redmine's established patterns for controllers and permissions

#### 2. Error Handling Strategy
```ruby
def create_packet
  begin
    # PDF generation
    # Attachment processing
    # Zip creation
    # File delivery
  rescue PDF::GenerationError => e
    # Handle PDF-specific errors
  rescue Attachment::ReadError => e
    # Handle attachment-specific errors
  rescue StandardError => e
    # Handle general errors
  ensure
    # Cleanup resources
  end
end
```

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- Use in-memory zip creation to avoid file system I/O
- Implement streaming for large files if needed
- Add size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Monitor memory usage during development

#### 4. Security Implementation
```ruby
before_action :authorize_packet_creation

def authorize_packet_creation
  deny_access unless User.current.allowed_to?(:create_packet, @project)
  deny_access unless @issue.visible?(User.current)
  # Additional security checks
end
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Large File Handling**: Risk of memory exhaustion
   - **Mitigation**: Implement size limits and streaming
   
2. **Permission Bypass**: Risk of unauthorized access
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive permission checking at multiple levels
   
3. **Resource Leaks**: Risk of temporary file accumulation
   - **Mitigation**: Use in-memory processing and proper cleanup

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Risk of download issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test across major browsers
   
2. **Performance Impact**: Risk of server slowdown
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization

### Low Risk Items
1. **UI Integration**: Risk of styling conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Follow Redmine UI patterns
   
2. **Plugin Conflicts**: Risk of conflicts with other plugins
   - **Mitigation**: Use standard Redmine extension points
