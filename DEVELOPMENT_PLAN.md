```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- Use `Redmine::Export::PDF::IssuesPdfHelper.issue_to_pdf`
- Use `Attachment.archive_attachments` or similar pattern
- Follow Redmine's established patterns for controllers and permissions

#### 2. Error Handling Strategy
```ruby
def create_packet
  begin
    # PDF generation
    # Attachment processing
    # Zip creation
    # File delivery
  rescue PDF::GenerationError => e
    # Handle PDF-specific errors
  rescue Attachment::ReadError => e
    # Handle attachment-specific errors
  rescue StandardError => e
    # Handle general errors
  ensure
    # Cleanup resources
  end
end
```

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- Use in-memory zip creation to avoid file system I/O
- Implement streaming for large files if needed
- Add size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Monitor memory usage during development

#### 4. Security Implementation
```ruby
before_action :authorize_packet_creation

def authorize_packet_creation
  deny_access unless User.current.allowed_to?(:create_packet, @project)
  deny_access unless @issue.visible?(User.current)
  # Additional security checks
end
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Large File Handling**: Risk of memory exhaustion
   - **Mitigation**: Implement size limits and streaming
   
2. **Permission Bypass**: Risk of unauthorized access
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive permission checking at multiple levels
   
3. **Resource Leaks**: Risk of temporary file accumulation
   - **Mitigation**: Use in-memory processing and proper cleanup

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Risk of download issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test across major browsers
   
2. **Performance Impact**: Risk of server slowdown
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization

### Low Risk Items
1. **UI Integration**: Risk of styling conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Follow Redmine UI patterns
   
2. **Plugin Conflicts**: Risk of conflicts with other plugins
   - **Mitigation**: Use standard Redmine extension points

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
