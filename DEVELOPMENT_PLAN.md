```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- Use `Redmine::Export::PDF::IssuesPdfHelper.issue_to_pdf`
- Use existing `PacketCreationService` module for multi-issue implementation
- Follow Redmine's established patterns for controllers and permissions

#### 2. Multi-Issue Implementation Strategy
```ruby
# Multi-issue service implementation using module pattern
module PacketCreationService
  def self.create_multi_packet(issues, pdf_contents_by_issue_id)
    # Fail-fast: validate all issues first
    validate_multi_packet_inputs(issues, pdf_contents_by_issue_id)
    
    # Create nested zip structure
    create_nested_zip_structure(issues, pdf_contents_by_issue_id)
  end
  
  private
  
  def validate_all_issues
    @issues.each do |issue|
      raise UnauthorizedError unless issue.visible?(User.current)
      raise UnauthorizedError unless issue.attachments_visible?(User.current)
    end
  end
  
  def create_nested_zip_structure
    # packet_123/ directory structure for each issue
  end
end
```

#### 3. Context Menu Integration Strategy
```ruby
# Hook-based approach for context menu integration
class IssueContextMenuHook < Redmine::Hook::ViewListener
  def view_issues_context_menu_end(context = {})
    issues = context[:issues] || []
    
    # Only show for multiple issues with proper permissions
    return '' if issues.length <= 1
    return '' unless all_issues_accessible?(issues)
    
    render_multi_packet_menu_item(issues)
  end
  
  private
  
  def all_issues_accessible?(issues)
    issues.all? do |issue|
      issue.visible?(User.current) && issue.attachments_visible?(User.current)
    end
  end
end
```

#### 4. Error Handling Strategy
```ruby
def create_multi_packet
  begin
    # Multi-issue validation
    # PDF generation for each issue
    # Nested zip creation
    # File delivery
  rescue UnauthorizedError => e
    # Handle permission-specific errors
  rescue PacketCreationError => e
    # Handle packet creation failures
  rescue StandardError => e
    # Handle general errors
  ensure
    # Cleanup resources
  end
end
```

#### 5. Performance Considerations
- Use in-memory zip creation to avoid file system I/O
- Implement memory-efficient nested zip creation
- Add reasonable limits for multi-issue packets (e.g., max 50 issues)
- Monitor memory usage during multi-issue processing

#### 6. Security Implementation
```ruby
before_action :authorize_multi_packet_creation

def authorize_multi_packet_creation
  @issues.each do |issue|
    deny_access unless issue.visible?(User.current)
    deny_access unless issue.attachments_visible?(User.current)
  end
end
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Large File Handling**: Risk of memory exhaustion
   - **Mitigation**: Implement size limits and streaming
   
2. **Permission Bypass**: Risk of unauthorized access
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive permission checking at multiple levels
   
3. **Resource Leaks**: Risk of temporary file accumulation
   - **Mitigation**: Use in-memory processing and proper cleanup

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Risk of download issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test across major browsers
   
2. **Performance Impact**: Risk of server slowdown
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization

### Low Risk Items
1. **UI Integration**: Risk of styling conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Follow Redmine UI patterns
   
2. **Plugin Conflicts**: Risk of conflicts with other plugins
   - **Mitigation**: Use standard Redmine extension points
